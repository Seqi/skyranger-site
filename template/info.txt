The XCOM 2 character creator uses a .bin file to represent individual soldiers.
Unlike the original XCOM, where you can just dump in names, XCOM 2 requires a
full specification of a soldier's customisation to import them into the game.

This file aims to document the patterns identifiable from the .bin files, and
how to change/create these files to allow us to modify our soldiers.

File Header:

  All files begin with 4 bytes of value [FF FF FF FF].

Length Prefixed Strings:

  All strings are length-prefixed using a 32 bit unsigned integer using little
  endian, and this length includes the null terminator. For example, the following
  sequence:

    [07 00 00 00] [61 61 61 61 61 61] [00]

  means "the following string is 7 bytes long." We can then assume the next 6
  bytes are characters of the string (byte 7 is the null terminator).

'None' Separator:

  The header is separated from the soldier list by the "None" value. This value
  is also used to separate soldiers in the soldier array.

Format:

  Each data type follows a specific format, usually revolving around number of
  tabs after an item. The general formula is:

  [PropertyName] [Tab] [Property Type] [Tab] [Type-Based Handler]

  This applies to each property type as such:

  ArrayProperty

    [Random Integer] [Tab] [Integer (Array Length)]

  StrProperty

    [Random Integer] [Tab] [Prefixed String (Value)]

  IntProperty

    [Random Integer] [Tab] [Integer (Value)]

  NameProperty

    [Random Integer] [Tab] [Prefixed String (Name Property)] [Tab]

  StructProperty

    [Struct Length] [Tab] [Prefixed String (Struct Name)] [Tab]
