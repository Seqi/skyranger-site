# Skyranger

A character generator for XCOM 2, a frontend for the [Skyranger](https://github.com/seqi/skyranger) library.

Based on an input, it will provide randomly generated soldiers with the given names.

Great for when you want to quickly and easily put your friends in XCOM, and then kill them.
